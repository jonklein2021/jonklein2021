### Hi, I'm Jon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science and Math student at Lehigh University interested in Zero-Knowledge acceleration, full-stack development, and combinatorics. Iâ€™m currently working on a parallel GPU implementation of [Pippenger's Algorithm for computing Multi-Scalar Multiplication](https://hackmd.io/@tazAymRSQCGXTUKkbh1BAg/Sk27liTW9) in [Lehigh's Mountaintop Summer Experience program](https://creativeinquiry.lehigh.edu/mountaintop-programs/mountaintop-summer-experience). On the side, I'm working on an image convolution program in C++ as well as a website for [Lehigh University Mathematics & Statistics Society](https://lehigh.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/LUMSS), of which I'm the Vice President.
