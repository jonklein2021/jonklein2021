## Hi, I'm Jon 👋

Here's a little bit about me:

- 🏢 I'm an incoming Software Dev Engineer at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) in NYC
- 👨‍🎓 I graduated from Lehigh University in 2025 with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Math through the [IDEAS honors program](https://catalog.lehigh.edu/coursesprogramsandcurricula/interdisciplinaryundergraduatestudy/ideas/)
- 💻 My top skills revolve around systems and backend development using Java, C++, and AWS
- 🧪 I'm a former computer systems researcher in fields such as zero-knowledge, numerical methods, and concurrent data structures
- 🧗‍♂️🤸‍♂ In my free time, I love to climb, hike, lift weights, and do [calisthenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics)

Feel free to reach out! :)
