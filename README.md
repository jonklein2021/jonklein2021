### Hi, I'm Jon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science and Math student at Lehigh University interested in numerical methods, parallel programming, full-stack development, and combinatorics. Here, you can find most of my projects, such as [chat-chambers](https://github.com/jonklein2021/chat-chambers), [image-convolution](https://github.com/jonklein2021/image-convolution), and [msm-playground](https://github.com/jonklein2021/msm-playground). Aside from school, I'm actively seeking Summer 2024 internships or research opportunities.
