### Hi, I'm Jon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science and Math student at Lehigh University interested in data structures, algorithms, combinatorics and graph theory. Here, you can find most of my projects, such as [rust-filestore](https://github.com/jonklein2021/rust-filestore), [chat-chambers](https://github.com/jonklein2021/chat-chambers), and [msm-playground](https://github.com/jonklein2021/msm-playground).
